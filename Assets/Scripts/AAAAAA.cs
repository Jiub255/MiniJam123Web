{/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    There's a giant spider living inside of earth with its army.
    One day they break the earth so there's no ground and you fall into an earth sized web.
    You have to fight your way to the giant spider at the center to win.
    You have to avoid sticky lines and minion spider children.
    Chunks of earth are caught in web? Kinda platformy? Or is that too "ground"?
    You play as an exterminator, so you have weapons. And it's more personal now.
    Spiders shoot venom, you have say three vials of antivenom, so 3 hp essentially.
    You spray poison from your poison pack thing.

    I don't know, not really feeling this one.

    There is no ground, web.


    An evil villian spider steals the ground one day as you're enjoying a nice stroll (on the ground).

    You have to follow the non sticky line through the web while shooting away spiders
        Sticky paths will have a collider in the middle to catch you and kill you.
            Have to use raycasts since not using rb movement. Raycast from start node to end node, if it hits collider, you die.
        Sometimes have dead ends so you have to go back, not too many though.

    Kill final spider boss to get the ground back.

    Score is spidersKilled/timeToComplete
